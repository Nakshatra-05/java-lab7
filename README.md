# 📱 Java Calculator Application

This is a **console-based Java Calculator Application** that performs basic mathematical operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Square, Cube, and Square Root. The program is modularized using multiple Java files—each operation is implemented as a separate class with clean code and built-in exception handling.
